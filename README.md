## Description
I built a text editor that runs in the browser. This is a single-page Progressive Web Application (PWA) and features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application also functions offline.

## Installation Instructions
Install Node.js before using this application.
